    aboutParaOne: "Throughout my undergraduate degree in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering and my work experiences in software engineering, I found myself to be passionate about the applications of software engineering in the biomedical industry. I started developing this interest after my third year of university, where I took some time off to gain some industry expereinces and explore different career paths through internships. I completed a total of two 8-month internships both in the fields of software engineering, machine learning and digital signal processing. My second internship was a research position at the DRDC (Defence Research and Development Canada) agency in Ottawa which was focused on using signal processing techniques to extract features from radar signals and then employing machine learning algorithms to classify the radar signals based on the features extracted. From these expereinces and my undergraduate studies, I found myself to be passionate about the applications of machine learning in the biomedical industry, specifically in the field of medical imaging. Have a look at my resume to learn more about my experiences",
    aboutParaTwo: "Beside my academics, I take inspirations from reading books as it helps me improve myself as an individual, work towards my goals in life and realize my true potential. I also love connecting with people and hearing about their own experiences. If you have something to share or would like to know more about me, letâ€™s connect and learn from each other!  ",
